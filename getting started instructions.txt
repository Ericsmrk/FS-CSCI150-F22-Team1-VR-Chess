USE GITHUB DESKTOP 
download github desktop
log into your github in gh desktop
clone your fork from the list of your repos
click view in explorer
make a shortcut of the gh folder and put on your desktop (this makes for easy access)
then click open in vs code

HOST LOCALLY (can use this as a default if you don't want to use gh pages)

open a terminal inside of the project folder you made
run : python -m http.server
go to http://localhost:8000 to see project
